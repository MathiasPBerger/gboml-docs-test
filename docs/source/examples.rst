Examples
========

This section describes three examples. The first example deals with a microgrid system design problem and illustrates the basic features of GBOML.
The second example is more sophisticated and focuses on a remote carbon-neutral fuel supply chain planning problem.
Finally, the third example is based on a hypothetical problem and illustrates the Python API.
