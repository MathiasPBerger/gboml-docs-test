Solver APIs
-----------

The GBOML parser interfaces with a variety of open source and commercial solvers in order to solve optimization models.
Direct access to solver APIs is provided, allowing users to tune algorithm parameters and query complementary information from solvers
(e.g., dual variables, slacks or basis ranges, when available). Such parameters must be placed in file named *solver_name.opt*.

To do: explain where to put these files and how to control queries to solver
