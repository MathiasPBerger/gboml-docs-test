How to use
==========

Two interfaces to GBOML exist, namely a command line interface and a Python scripting interface. Both exploit nodes and hyperedges defined in GBOML files with the command line executing directly all the different steps to retrieve the problem's solution and the Python scripting which provids more freedom in the model building.
